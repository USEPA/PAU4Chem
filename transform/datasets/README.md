1. [chemical_price](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem/tree/master/transform/datasets/chemical_price) contains the relationship between the PAU methods and the prices of the chemicals/categories.
2. [intermediate_pau_datasets](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem/tree/master/transform/datasets/intermediate_pau_datasets) and [final_pau_datasets](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem/tree/master/transform/datasets/final_pau_datasets) have the information for the PAU methods. However, the lattet has the final
version after imputing recycling and energy recovery efficiencies.
3. [pau_expenditure_and_cost](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem/tree/master/transform/datasets/pau_expenditure_and_cost) has the information about the pollution abatement operating expenses and capital expenditure.
4. [waste_flow](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem/tree/master/transform/datasets/waste_flow) contains the information for the waste input flows.
5. [pau_positions](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem/tree/master/transform/datasets/pau_positions) contains if a PAU method may be after or before another.
